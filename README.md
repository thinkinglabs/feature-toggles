# feature-toggles
A Java implementation of the [implementation techniques for feature toggles](https://martinfowler.com/articles/feature-toggles.html#ImplementationTechniquesa) by [Pete Hodgson](https://twitter.com/ph1).

## Naive Implementaiton
This uses `if-else` conditions in the business logic. As a result toggle point and toggle router are at the same place.
